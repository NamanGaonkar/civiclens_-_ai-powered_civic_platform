# CivicLens — AI-powered Civic Engagement Platform

An innovative React + TypeScript web application designed to transform how communities report, analyze, and resolve civic issues using real-time maps, AI-assisted analysis, and interactive dashboards.

---

##  Overview

**CivicLens** is a smart civic engagement platform that empowers citizens to report civic issues efficiently while providing administrators with AI-powered insights and real-time analytics. The app combines interactive mapping, AI chatbot assistance, and intuitive mobile-first design to bridge the gap between communities and city services.

### Key Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Vite)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Spider‑Man inspired red/blue theme
- **Maps**: react-leaflet + OpenStreetMap
- **Backend**: Convex (serverless backend with real-time queries)
- **UI Components**: lucide-react icons, Framer Motion animations, Sonner toasts
- **Auth**: Convex Auth (anonymous + email/password support)

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- A modern web browser

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository** (once pushed to GitHub):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NamanGaonkar/civiclens_-_ai-powered_civic_platform.git
cd civiclens_-_ai-powered_civic_platform
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```powershell
npm install
```

3. **Start the dev server**:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

4. **Open in browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in terminal)

### Notes
- Tailwind CSS directives (`@tailwind`, `@apply`) are build-time processed — static analyzers may flag them as warnings, but the dev server handles them correctly.
- Leaflet maps require the CSS import in `main.tsx` — this is already configured.
- Auth uses Convex Auth with anonymous sign-in support.
